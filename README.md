here we are using a hardcoded 10000 lamports(0.00001 wSOL) to buy every shitcoin at the launch ,better changing it to a lower value for testing.
fund the wallet very little amount of sol ,wrap half of that https://solanacookbook.com/references/token.html#how-to-manage-wrapped-sol
```bash 
cargo run 
```
